README - Data Analysis for Ajax
​
​
# Introduction
In the world of sports, data analysis has become an integral part of decision-making for clubs like Ajax. Leveraging data and technology, we aim to manage our team effectively and make decisions that enhance the club's value. 
​
This README describes the objectives and how we achieve them.
​
# Main Goal
Our primary objective is to identify and acquire a young player with great potential at a reasonable price. This player will add value to our club and contribute to our future success.
​
# Secondary Objectives
- Explore the data to identify potential relationships between variables.
- Group player types to better visualize important characteristics among them.
- Examine if age correlates with the variables we've identified as important for our study.
- Find a way to select the best player.
​
# Exploratory Analysis
- Libraries and Data Clening
​
We begin by importing essential libraries for data analysis, such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy. We load the dataset "Fifa 23 Players Data.csv" and clean the column names to remove any inconsistencies.
​
- General Analysis of the Information
We analyze player characteristics based on their positions. We categorize positions into broader player types (e.g., Defense, Midfield, Attack, Goalkeeper) and examine key performance attributes for each category.
​
- Correlation Among Numeric Columns
We examine the correlation between numeric columns to understand relationships within the dataset.
​
- Analysis by Age: Potential, Value, and Overall
We analyze the relationship between age and potential, value, and overall attributes. This analysis helps us identify young players with potential for acquisition.
​
- Prediction of Value Based on Age for Goalkeepers
We create a predictive model to estimate the value of goalkeepers based on their age, assuming they play in a defensive position and have specific attributes.
​
# AJAX Analysis
As part of our analysis, we explore our club, AJAX, to understand the current state of our team.
​
We retrieve player data for AJAX and calculate key statistics:
    - Mean Age
    - Mean Overall Rating
    - Mean Potential
    - Total Value of the Team
    - Total Wage Cost
​
We also analyze our current squad to identify potential improvements and we created some insights. We've created various plots to visually represent the relationship between variables.
​
In the transfer market, some of our players were sold for the release clause. It was decided that the proceeds from these sales would be invested in acquiring a new player.
​
- Looking for the Best Player to Sign
To find the best player to sign, we have several criteria:
​
    - Affordable wage
    - Good potential
    - Young age
    - High rating
    - Release clause.
​

# Conclusion
Our data analysis provides valuable insights for AJAX to make informed decisions regarding player acquisitions. By focusing on younger players with high potential, AJAX can build a more competitive team for the future. We have also explored the current status of our club and identified areas for potential improvement. This analysis will be instrumental in shaping our strategies and decisions.
